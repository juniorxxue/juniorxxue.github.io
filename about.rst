Hi, I'm a PhD student at `HKU Programming Languages Group`_. I'm currently working on contextual type inference by generlising techniques of bidirectional typing.

Previously I've got my MPhil degree from HKU in 2023 and BEng degree from Nankai University in 2020. I did two internships before doing PL research: Ubisoft and Lilith Games.
