title: Advanced Topics in Haskell
---

There're many good books covering introductory parts of Haskell, but advanced topics are sparse around the Internet. In this book, I try to give overview of those topics I found interesting around several years when doing my doctoral study.

I'm not an expert in Haskell, and this book, is obviously, baised and limited to my knowledge. Give me feedback when you feel something wrong.
