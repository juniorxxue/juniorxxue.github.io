        <p>In languages with first-class labels, labels are treated as first-class values that can be passed as arguments. I’ll use Javascript to explain how it differs from our familiar ones.</p>
<pre><code>const person = {
  name: &quot;john&quot;,
  age: 50,
};

static_access = person.age;
dyn_label = &quot;age&quot;;
dynamic_access = person[dyn_label];</code></pre>
<p>In normal record calculi, labels are part of syntax and always statically known, as <code>static_access</code>. Thus, <code>age</code> is not a first-class label.</p>
<p>Javascript also supports a <em>computed field access</em> which allows you to give a variable which value can be assigned in runtime, then compute the result. And <code>dyn_label</code> is a first-class label.</p>
<h2 id="why-bother">Why bother?</h2>
<p>While the behavior of dynamic semantics is straightforward, designing the corresponding type system is a challenge. For the purpose of this demonstration, I will be using” <em>qualified type system</em>:</p>
<p>In expression <code>person.age</code>, <code>_.age</code> is a operator that access constant label age, so its type can be</p>
<pre><code>(_.age) :: ∀ r a. (r\age) =&gt; {age :: a | r} -&gt; a</code></pre>
<p><code>_age</code> indicates that given a record containing label <code>age</code>, return the term with the type associated with label <code>age</code>.</p>
<p>In expression <code>person["age"]</code>, since <code>"age"</code> can be given in runtime, <code>_._</code> become a operator and its type is</p>
<pre><code>(_[_]) ::∀ r l a. (r\l) =&gt; {l :: a | r} -&gt; Lab l -&gt; a</code></pre>
<p>Though <code>"age"</code> is a string, we view it as a <code>Lab</code> type. The type of <code>_[_]</code> means given a record containing a arbitrary label <code>l</code>, and a label <code>l</code>, return the term with the type associated with label <code>l</code>.</p>
