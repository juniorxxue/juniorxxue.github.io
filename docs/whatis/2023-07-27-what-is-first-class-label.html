        <p>Take the definition from “First-class labels for extensible rows”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In language with first class labels, Labels become first-class values that can be passed as arguments.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I use Javascript to illustrate the difference between it and our familiar ones.</p>
<pre><code>const person = {
  name: &quot;john&quot;,
  age: 50,
};

static_access = person.age;
dyn_label = &quot;age&quot;;
dynamic_access = person[dyn_label];</code></pre>
<p>In normal record calculi, labels are part of syntax and always statically known, as <code>static_access</code>. Thus, <code>age</code> is not a first-class label.</p>
<p>Javascript also supports a <em>computed field access</em> which allows you to give a variable which value can be assigned in runtime, then compute the result. And <code>dyn_label</code> is a first-class label.</p>
<h2 id="why-bother">Why bother?</h2>
<p>The behavior of dynamic semantics is straightforward,</p>
