        <p>In this post, I’ll try to explain what is gradual guarantee intuitively and also formally. There’re three main reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>When I was a Racket fan during my undergraduate, I was informed and curious about that Typed Racket is a well-designed gradual language and there’s a soundness proof which is ensured by a contract system that interacts between Racket (untyped) and its type system.</p></li>
<li><p>One of my colleagues keep working on designing gradual type systems, and she’s given <a href="https://hkuplg.github.io/problem/session/2022/06/21/Relational-Parametricity-and-Gradual-Guarantee/">many talks</a> involved with gradual guarantee in our seminars, but I never really got its idea.</p></li>
<li><p>Sometimes I learn some formalisation techniques from Jeremy Siek’s <a href="https://github.com/jsiek/gradual-typing-in-agda">gradual-typing-in-agda</a>. It might be a good chance to study GTLC (Gradually Typed Lambda Calculus) seriously.</p></li>
</ul>
