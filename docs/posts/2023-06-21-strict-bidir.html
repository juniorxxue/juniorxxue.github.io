        <p>Let’s take some words from <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.05839.pdf">Bidirectional Typing Survey</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Drawing inspiration from relevance logic, which requires variables to be used at least once (as opposed to the exactly-once constraint of linear logic), Chlipala et al. [2005] require a let-bound variable to be used at least once. This allows them to reverse the typing rule for let-expressions, reducing the annotation burden of the basic Pfenning recipe: no annotation is needed on the let-bound expression. Their typing contexts contain checking variables, whose moding is similar to the variables in our backwards bidirectional system. Such a variable must occur at least once in a checking position; that occurrence determines the type of the variable, which can be treated as synthesizing in all other occurrences.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This conclusion actually motivates quite well, we make it concrete here: consider to check a let binding expression <code>let f = \x.x in f</code> with the type <code>Int -&gt; Int</code>. We can desugar this one into a function application, which becomes to check <code>(\f. f) (\x. x)</code>. Note here this term cannot be checked by conventional rules of bidirectional typing since we know nothing about the function and arguments.</p>
<pre><code>                       ?A = Int -&gt; Int
                      ------------------------------ Var
T; . |- \x. x &lt;= ?A    T; f : ?A |- f &lt;= Int -&gt; Int
--------------------------------------------------- App-Guess
T; . |- (\f. f) (\x. x) &lt;= Int -&gt; Int</code></pre>
<p>We have a seperate context used for storing the unkown types, which will be solved in the variable case and get the information back.</p>
<p>It’s a temp understanding of this idea, I only have a vague intuition that if we have a strong property that “variables to be used at least once” then we can solve the <code>?A</code> but I haven’t get into the detail yet. Will come back and say more on this.</p>
