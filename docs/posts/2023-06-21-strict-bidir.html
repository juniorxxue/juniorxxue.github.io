        <p>First, letâ€™s take some words from <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.05839.pdf">Bidirectional Typing Survey</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Drawing inspiration from relevance logic, which requires variables to be used at least once (as opposed to the exactly-once constraint of linear logic), Chlipala et al. [2005] require a let-bound variable to be used at least once. This allows them to reverse the typing rule for let-expressions, reducing the annotation burden of the basic Pfenning recipe: no annotation is needed on the let-bound expression. Their typing contexts contain checking variables, whose moding is similar to the variables in our backwards bidirectional system. Such a variable must occur at least once in a checking position; that occurrence determines the type of the variable, which can be treated as synthesizing in all other occurrences.</p>
