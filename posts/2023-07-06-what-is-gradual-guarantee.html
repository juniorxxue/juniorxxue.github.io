title: What Is Gradual Guarantee?
---

<div class="qblock">
Any prerequisites before reading this post?
</div>

<div class="ablock">
I suggest reading Jeremy Siek's <a href="https://wphomes.soic.indiana.edu/jsiek/what-is-gradual-typing/">What is Gradual Typing</a>, which gives an intuitive explanation of gradual typing.

<div class="qblock">
Okay, so why are you curious about gradual guarantee?
</div>

<div class="ablock">
There're three main reasons:

<ul>
    <li>When I was a Racket fan during my undergraduate, I was informed and curious about that Typed Racket is a well-designed gradual language and there’s a soundness proof which is ensured by a contract system that interacts between Racket (untyped) and its type system.</li>

    <li>One of my colleagues keep working on designing gradual type systems, and she’s given many talks involved with gradual guarantee in our seminars, shamelessly, I never really got its idea. </li>

    <li>Sometimes I learn some formalisation techniques from Jeremy Siek’s gradual-typing-in-agda. It might be a good chance to study GTLC (Gradually Typed Lambda Calculus) seriously.</li>
</ul>

<div class="qblock">
Then, why should I learn about it?
</div>

<div class="ablock">
Gradual guarantee has already been widely taken as a criteria in designing gradual type systems.
