title: Many Intuitions of Many Monads
---

<!-- I'm the one of ordinary programmers that have spent many years to learn Monad many times. I've been trying to understand every type of the Monad related operations, and conclude some intuition from doing so. However, gradually when I'm being tutor to teach undergraduates monads, I realized that there's no need to be. Just showcasing them many monads and help them develop each intuition of each monad, and that's way enough for programming with it.

So, there's is a cheat-sheet article more than a tutorial of monads. -->

I believe that the intuition of monads is to compose computation into larger computations, but this is not always be. Personally, I'd like to develop each intuition for each monad.

## IO Monad

Monad allows us to compose several IO actions into larger ones.
