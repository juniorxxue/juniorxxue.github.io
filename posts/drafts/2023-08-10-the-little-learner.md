I started reading since I will take the Machine Learning course this semester, but I have to quit this course for the schedule conflict. So I leave the reading plan for the later.

## Chapter 1 and 2

It defines function `y = wx + b` and its parameters (`w` and `b`), arguments (`x`), data set, tensor and scalar, rank and shape of the tensor. Rank and shape are defined as recursive functions and have their properties.

## Interlude
> “This interlude is about how it is possible to extend functions that operate on fixed ranks of tensors into functions that also accept tensors of different ranks. We use the concept of descending into the higher-ranked tensors to accomplish this.”
