In [TypeScript Handbook](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/type-inference.html#contextual-typing):

> Contextual typing applies in many cases. Common cases include arguments to function calls, right hand sides of assignments, type assertions, members of object and array literals, and return statements.

Simply speaking, contextual typing is one form of type inference in the use of contextual information.
